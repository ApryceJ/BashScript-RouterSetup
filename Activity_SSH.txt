Tasks
Generate Keypair (note the comment is based on your current login id but is for usability purposes)
Install keypair on a "remote" CentOS VM that you can login to.
Configure ssh-agent via the Passwords and Keys / Seahorse GUI within the Gnome Desktop to load your new SSH key at login time (this is semi-automatic).
Logout and login of your GUI session and use ssh-add to verify that you have added your SSH keys to the ssh-adgent at login time.
Questions
Describe the purpose of the following files
~/.ssh/id_rsa
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
~/.ssh/known_hosts
~/.ssh/authorized_keys
~/.ssh/config
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
/etc/ssh/sshd_config
Describe the purpose of ssh-agent and ssh-add
What is the relationship between a public and private key.
Hints
The generic setup process is for public key authentication is:

Generate private key and a public key i.e. key pair. with a secret passphrase to protect your private key.
Install your public key on an SSH server machine.
Generating Key Pairs with ssh-keygen
These pairs consist of a private key (your digital identity that sits on the client machine) and a public key (that sits on the server machine). To do this, use the ssh-keygen program to produce either a DSA or RSA key.

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "username@my.bcit.ca"
Installing Public Key on another Server
Install your public keys on an account on your project server.

For cryptographic keys, you must set up an association between the username and the public key. After creating the key pair on the local host, you must install your public key in your account on the remote host.

To install a public key into an account on a remote server editing the file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys appending your public â€�i.e., the contents of the id_rsa.pub file you generated on the local machine. A typical authorized_keys file contains a list of public-key data, one key per line.

Make sure the files are only writable by your account as the SSH server is picky about file and directory permissions and may refuse authentication if the remote account's SSH configuration files have insecure permissions.

You can speed up the above using the ssh-copy-id command.
